# <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Function Basics </h1>

**Function arguments are variables of some supported data type that are processed within the body of the function. It can take input as an argument and return value.**

**PHP has more than 1000 built-in functions, and in addition, you can also create your own functions.**

## Advantages:

1. Functions reduce the complexity of a program and give it a modular structure.

2. A function can be defined only once and called many times.

3. It saves a lot of code writing because you don't need to write the same logic multiple times, you can write the logic once and reuse it.

**Built-in Functions:** PHP has thousands of built-in functions. For a complete reference and examples, you can go to this [function reference](https://www.php.net/manual/en/funcref.php).

**User Defined Functions:** Apart from built-in functions, We can also create our own functions and call them easily.
A user-defined function looks something like this:

```php
<?php
Function functionname(){
//Code
}
functionname(); // Calling Function
?>
```

**Note:** A function name should only start with letters and underscore only. It canâ€™t start with numbers and special symbols.

**Example:**

```php
<?php
function helloMsg() {
  echo "Hello world!";
}
helloMsg(); // call the function
?>
```
