# PHP Overview

<b>
PHP is a server-side scripting language, which is used to manage dynamic web pages, databases and build websites with features like session tracking and e-commerce. On a day of 1995, Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of “Hypertext Preprocessor” also known as the PHP language. It is also integrated with several popular databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle etc.

## Basic Syntax PHP

A PHP script can be written anywhere inside the HTML document. A PHP script starts with `<?php` tag and ends with `?>`. We can write our logic inside this tag and it will be executed accordingly.

```php
<?php
// PHP code goes here
?>
```

## Displaying output in php

In php,Output is displayed on the browser using echo as follows:

```php
<?php
echo "hello";
?>
```

## Hello World

A basic PHP Hello World program looks something like this. We will use a built-in PHP function “echo” to output the text “Hello World!” on our webpage.

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>My first PHP page</h1>
<?php
echo "Hello World!";
?>
</body>
</html>
```
