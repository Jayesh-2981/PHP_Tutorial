# <h1 style="text-align: center;"> PHP Comments </h1>

<b>A comment is a part of the coding file that the programmer does not want to execute, rather the programmer uses it to either explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of a specific part of code while testing.</b>

## PHP supports several ways of commenting:

### Single Line Comments

```php
<?php
// This is a single-line comment
# This is also a single-line comment
?>
```

### Multiline Line Comments

```php
<?php
/*
This is a
multiple line
Comment.
*/
?>
```
